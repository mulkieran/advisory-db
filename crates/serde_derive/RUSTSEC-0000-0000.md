# Executable in packaged crate

Affected versions of this crate distribute a pre-compiled executable. This
executable, `serde_derive-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, is used to
automatically derive implementations of the `Serialize` and `Deserialize`
traits on `x86_64`. There is no fallback to using the compiled source that is
used on other architectures.

This may be a problem for downstream packagers, who may be subject to special
rules regarding executables from upstream in packages.
